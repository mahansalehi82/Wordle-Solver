# Wordle-Solver
Wordle Solver with Python

The code needs the words.txt file in order to work as the file contains all the 5 letter words that get checked with the queries

The first input is for letters that their place has been determined, 
lets say A is the first letter and P is the third letter, then you input A_P__ in the first line

The second input is letters that are in the word and have no certain place yet, lets say L and E are those letters,
then you input LE in the second line

And the last input is letters that are not in the word for certain
